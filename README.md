Homework #1: HTML and Client-Server Technology 
First homework assignment in CIS 122.
Create the web page on the next page according to the steps and specifications below based on our classroom lectures and discussions and your Internet research. Since we are not adding CSS yet, there will be little formatting to the web page.
1. Create a blank HTML file and name it: clientserver.html
Note: it is strongly recommended you never use spaces or uppercase letters in web page
filenames.
2. Add the code necessary to make the page HTML 5 compliant, i.e. DocType, <head> section (the
three <meta> tags, <link> tag, <title> tag within it), <body> section, open/close <html>, etc.
3. Inside the <head> section, add the line to link this HTML file to an external CSS file named
style.css. We will not create the style.css in this homework; we will create it in the next
homework assignment.
4. Use an <h1> tag to create a heading for your web page that informs the visitor the web page is
about client/server computing. For example:
Client/Server Computing
5. Below that <h1>, create a paragraph with your name in it. For example:
By John Smith
6. Next, add an <h2> tag with this text: What is the client/server model?
7. Next, inside an HTML paragraph tag, write a paragraph of text defining and describing what the
client/server model is. You can use our class lecture notes and/or Internet research, but
paraphrase it in your own words (do not use a direct quote).
8. Next, add another <h2>: Advantages of the client/server model
9. Next, add the following HTML paragraph:
Several major advantages of the client/server model are:
10. Next, create an HTML numbered list and write four advantages of the client/server model.
These can be written as single sentences or a fragmented sentence. You can use our class
lecture notes and/or Internet research, but paraphrase it in your own words (do not use a direct
quote).
11. Next, add another <h2>: Examples of client/server software
12. Next, create a three column by six row HTML table with the top row and left column as shown in
the screenshot on the previous page and below. Use the <th> tags instead of <td> tags in the
first row to achieve the centered, bold-faced format.
Then, fill in the remaining/blank cells with the correct corresponding examples. Include at least
two examples for each cell/software. You can use our class lecture notes and/or Internet
research, but paraphrase it in your own words (do not use a direct quote).
Software Client Server
Web
Email
FTP
Web Development/Coding
Database
13. Next, add another <h2>: Examples of TCP/IP protocols
14. Next, create an HTML bulleted list and describe (with a single sentence or fragmented sentence)
what these four protocols are: FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, DHCP, SMTP
15. Next, add another <h2>: Examples of network utilities and services
16. Next, create an HTML bulleted list and describe (with a single sentence, multiple sentences, or
fragmented sentences) what these five network utilities and services are: ping, tracert,
pathping, whois, ipconfig.
17. Next, add a heading for the examples of relative and absolute addresses and then create a two
column by two row table below it with the table heading row shown and, in the second row,
three examples of both relative and absolute addresses. Be sure the relative address examples
include both one to a file in sub-folder and a parent folder.
18. Validate your web page to ensure it is HTML compliant (with no errors).
19. FTP/publish your web page to the cislinux.hfcc.edu server so it is publically available
We will cover how to do this in-class. There is also an instructions handout in eThink/Moodle
under the Help Section. I strongly recommend practicing this process several days a week.
